# Smith-Waterman-Algorithm
Exactly the same as needleman algorithm https://github.com/YoussefEmad99/Needleman-Wunsch-Bioinformatics , the only differences are:
1- No negative values in the matrix
2- We start the matrix from the highest value (not from the last value like in needleman)
3- We stop when we find a 0 (not at the last value like in needleman)
